*** Changes from release 1.0 to 1.1 ***

(1.1c1 released)

- Fixed rendering of symbols containing nested polygons (broken in
  1.1b3).

- Added 'coords' method to the Path type.  This returns the current
  path as a polyline.  If the path consists of multiple path fragments,
  the return value is undefined. (experimental)

(1.1b3 released)

- The Windows installer now uses Freetype 2.1.10.  This seems to fix
  the issue with irregular baselines reported for some fonts.

- Performance: changes to how and when drawing adapters are created,
  and proper clipping in the rasterizer can result in massive speedups
  for some applications.

- Added experimental 'setantialias' method to the drawing context.
  Pass in 0 to disable antialiasing, 1 to enable it.  Antialiasing
  is enabled by default.

- Adjust the size of filled objects (including polygons) depending
  on the pen width.  If no pen is used, filled antialiased objects
  are expanded by a half pixel, to avoid banding.  If a pen is used,
  the objects are shrunk by a half pen width. (experimental)

(1.1b2 released; internal release only)

- Fixed background color bug for non-RGBA images.  The third
  argument to the Draw constructor now works properly for all
  modes.

- Fixed big resource leak in the Draw(im) constructor.  The alternate
  form (Draw(mode, size)) does not leak (reported by Håkan Karlsson).

- Added Path object.  Path objects can be used instead of coordinates
  with the 'line' and 'polygon' primitives.  Path objects can also be
  used as symbols.

(1.1b1 released)

- Use ImageColor.getrgb to resolve colors.  

(1.0 final released)
